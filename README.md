# ESP-8266-LED-controller-and-alarm
Creates a website that can remote control LED to any color the user wishes and creates an alarm clock that simulates sunrise.
The LED strip I used was the WS2812B with 60 LED's, if you have a different LED strip then you need to change the code. 
I also used the ESP 8266, if you use the ESP32 or any other board you need to modify the code. I use a 5V 3A power supply to power the board and the LED's.
